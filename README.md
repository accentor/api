# Accentor API
API for Accentor, a modern music server focusing on metadata.

## Why use Accentor?
Accentor gives you complete control over your music. You can build your own collection (with good old CD's, bandcamp downloads, ...) in the soundquality that you want and stream it either through the [web frontend](https://github.com/accentor/web) or [android app](https://github.com/accentor/android).

Accentor is focused on metadata. We allow you to add detailed metadata to your music collection, beyond what the tags inside an audio file are capable of. Album and tracks can have multiple artists with a different name on different albums/tracks, albums can have multiple labels and tracks can have multiple genres.

The metadata is completely in your control: you can edit them however you want.
